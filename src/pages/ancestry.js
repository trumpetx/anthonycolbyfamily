        <h1>Anthony's Ancestry</h1>

        <p>Over the years many fanciful versions of Anthony Colby's ancestry have been told. An eminent genealogist (and
            descendant) researched the truth and the result was published.

        <br/>Anthony Colby’s Purported Ancestry

        <br/>By Glade Ian Nelson
        </b></p>

        <p>James W. Colby’s frequently unreliable ‘Colby family History’, published in 1895, is the basis for the
            statement that Anthony Colby of Massachusetts Bay Colony was the son of Thomas Colby, Esquire, by his second
            wife Beatrice Felton of Beccles, Co. Suffolk, England. Since the printing of that volume, this relationship
            has been repeated in many other publications with elaboration’s upon the various royal personages which fill
            the ancestral pedigrees of the Colby and Felton families. Most recently it has appeared in Michel L. Call,
            ‘Royal Ancestors of some L.D.S. Families’ (Salt Lake City: 1972), and in Count d’Angerville, ‘Living
            Descendants of Blood Royal’, vol. 4.
        </p><p>
        While the first book is so error-filled as to make it completely untrustworthy to any serious student of royal
        genealogies, the second does contain some lineage’s of merit. To the discredit of both authors they fail their
        readers by not giving documentary source material or references for data contained in their books. It should not
        be too surprising, therefore, that the claim of the Massachusetts immigrant, Anthony Colby, as the son of Thomas
        and Beatrice (Felton) Colby is without substantiation and most likely completely fallacious.
    </p><p>
        Certain lineage societies have rather blindly accepted this lineage in the past and, I presume, continue to do
        so. (See Langston and Buck, ‘Pedigrees of Some of the Emperor Charlemagne’s Descendants’, Vol. ii (1974), p.
        96--Ed.). Therefore, in order to correct this purported parentage and to warn those who might be tempted to
        accept the questionable lineage, the following information is presented.
    </p><p>
        Anthony Colby came to New England with the Winthrop Fleet in 1630 for in that year he was of Boston and recorded
        as a church member. He was of Cambridge as early as 1632 when he owned land and buildings there, and was still
        there when, on 14 May 1634, he took the oath of "freeman" before the General Court in Boston. About 1637 he
        moved to the settlement at Ipswich, but soon thereafter moved on to Salisbury, then called Colchester, where he
        received land in the first division of 1639. Additional grants of land were given to him by the town of
        Salisbury in 1640 and 1643. Anthony Colby was one of the original settlers of the "newtown", now called
        Amesbury, where he was made a commomer on 19 March 1654, receiving a grant of land there in that same year as
        well as grants in subsequent years.(1) He died intestate, 11 Feb. 1660/1, in Salisbury, Mass., and the inventory
        was taken on 9 March 1660/1, (2) with the division made 9 April 1661.(3) Although as early as 1939, information
        concerning the identity of Anthony Colby’s wife was printed by Donald Lines Jacobus, (4) many errors have since
        been printed concerning her. Mr. Jacobus clearly pointed out that Anthony Colby married after coming to New
        England, probably between 1630 and 1632, the widow Susannah Waterman of Boston, Mass. She married, thirdly,
        about 1663-4, William Whitridge, a carpenter from Gloucester who died 5 Dec. 1668, leaving her a widow for the
        third time. Susannah died 8 July 1689 in Salisbury, Mass. Various accounts state her maiden name to have been
        Haddon and make her either a sister or daughter of William Sargent, and still others ascribe her to her the name
        Nutting. None of these claims, however, is substantiated by documented evidence, leaving her maiden name
        unknown.(5) Anthony and Susannah Colby had the following children:(6) i. John, bapt. 8 Sept.1633, Boston, Mass.,
        d 11 Feb 1673/4; m. Salisbury, 14 Jan 1655/6, Frances Hoyt. ii. Sarah, b. 6 March 1634/5, Cambridge, Mass.; m. 6
        March 1653/4, Orlando Bagley. iii. Child, b. ca.1637, prob. Ipswich, Mass.; may have d. y. (Savage states there
        were four children older than Isaac. which is the basis for the inclusion of this unnamed child). iv. Samuel, b.
        ca. 1638, Ipswich, d. 1716; m. Elizabeth Sargent. v. Isaac, b. 6 July 1640, Salisbury, d. by 1691; m. Martha
        Parratt. vi. Rebecca, b. 11 March 1643, Salisbury, d. by 1673; m. Haverhill, Mass., 9 Sept 1661, John Williams.
        vii. Mary, b. 19 Sept 1647, Salisbury; m. Amesbury, 25 Sept. 1668, William Sargent. viii. Thomas, b. 8 March
        1650/1, Salisbury; estate inventory taken 31 March 1691; m. 16 Sept 1674, Hannah Rowell.
    </p><p>
        Examination of English Colby records sheds light on the problem at hand. The 1612 Visitation of Suffolk contains
        the family of Thomas and Beatrice (Felton) Colby as "Thomas, son and heir; Charles, second son, obit; John,
        obit; Anthony; Edmond, obit; Philip; Francis; Huntington; Beatrice, mar to Edmond Thurston of Colchester; Mary,
        mar. to John Copuldyke of Kirby in suff.; Penelope, mar. to Sir Walter Aston in Chesh.; Katherin, unm." (7)
    </p><p>
        Thus it can be seen that there was a son Anthony belonging to this family. However, justification for rejecting
        him as the immigrant Anthony is substantial, as will be further explained. Thomas Colby of Beccles, Co. Suffolk,
        England, wrote his will 8 June 1588 and it was proved that same year at the Prerogative Court of Canterbury. (8)
        In this will Thomas referred to "Beatrice my well beloved wife" to whom he gave all his manors for life as well
        as other items. He then bequeathed to his "son Thomas from and after the decease of my wife all my manors. . ."
        Provision was made that should the son Thomas die without legal heirs, the lands were to be entailed to his
        other living sons, Anthony, Edmond, Philip, Francis and Huntington, in that order. Concerning these last five
        sons mention is made of a distribution of an annual rent in the sum of 9 pounds and 6 shillings to each of the
        sons from a farm in Brundish, co. Suffolk, that "eache and every of them shall begin to receyve their saide
        annuitic or portion at twentie years of age untill whiche time I will and devise that my executors shall putt
        the saide money during their minorities or manage to the only profit and bringing upp of my said sonnes in vertu
        good education and bearinge. . ." Thomas also mentioned "my thre (sic) daughters and the child whiche my wife is
        at the making. . . at their age of twentie yeares or at their severall dayes of marriage. . ." Thomas made his
        son Thomas and his brother-in-law Anthony Felton executors of his will, with his brother Francis Colby as
        supervisor. The children of Thomas and Beatrice (with approximate birth years based on the best documentation
        available) were: (9) i. Thomas, b. ca. 1566; m. Brundish, 1599, Amy Brampton; lived in Brundish where six of
        their children were baptized, with two additional children mentioned in the 1612 visitation of Suffolk. ii.
        Charles, 2nd son, b. ca. 1568; appears only in the 1612 Suffolk Visitation as already deceased; not mentioned in
        father’s will in 1588 nor in that of Uncle Francis in 1599. iii. Beatrice, b. ca. 1570; under 20 years of age in
        1588 when her father’s will was made; m. Edmond Thurston of Colchester; her unnamed children are referred to in
        her brother Philip’s will in 1643. iv. John, 3rd son, b. ca. 1572; mentioned only as deceased in the 1612
        Visitation; not mentioned in the wills of his father (1588 or Uncle Francis (1599). v. Anthony, 4th son, b. ca.
        1574; erroneously claimed as the New England immigrant. vi. Mary, b. ca. 1576, m. 1598 in Beccles, John
        Copuldyke of Kirby, Suffolk. vii. Edmond, 5th son, b. ca. 1578; mentioned in will of his father (1588) and in
        his Uncle’s (1599), but listed in the 1612 Visitation of Suffolk as already deceased. viii. Philip, 6th son, b.
        ca. 1580; m. 1609 in Beccles, Lady Dorothy (Bacon) Gawdy, daughter of Sir Nicholas Bacon, Knt. and widow of Sir
        Bassingbourn Gawdy, Bart. She d. 1621 at age 47. Philip’s will in 1643 mentioned only one daughter. This will,
        referred to later on, contains additional valuable information concerning his brothers, sisters, nephews and
        nieces. ix. Penelope. b. ca. 1582, m. Sir Walter Aston; mentioned in brother Philip’s will as "my loveing sister
        ye Lady Aston." x. Francis, 7th son, b. ca. 1584; m. 1610 in Beccles, Margaret Sampson, daughter and coheir of
        George Sampson of Sampson’s Hall, Kersey, Suffolk; gentleman of the Privy Chamber to Prince Henry. Francis and
        Margaret had one son Hertford aged 1 in the 1612 Visitation. xi. Huntington, 8th son, b. ca. 1586; knighted 28
        Nov. 1616. xii. Katherine, b. shortly after her father’s will (1588) in which he refers to "the child whiche my
        wife is at the making." Unmarried when the 1612 Visitation was recorded. The Anthony Colby living in Beccles,
        England, son of Thomas and Beatrice (Felton) Colby, as has been pointed out, was under 20 years of age in 1588
        when his father made his will. His eldest brother Thomas was the only one of the family not designated as under
        age. Consequently Thomas’s birth year cannot be placed later than 1568 and was probably just one or two years
        before that date. The Visitation of Suffolk taken in 1561 (10) indicated the father as then married to Ursella,
        Lady Brend, his first wife. Therefore, Thomas’s second marriage, to Beatrice Felton, occurred subsequent to
        1561. The 1612 Visitation of Suffolk lists the children of Thomas and Beatrice, listing Anthony as the fourth of
        their eight sons along with four daughters. Other listings of the brothers follow the same basic position of
        Anthony as fourth son. Given this information, and knowing all of Thomas and Beatrice’s children were born
        between 1561 and 1588, their son Anthony’s birth year can be approximated as 1574. Certainly a few years
        variance is possible, one way or the other, but reason dictates it cannot be placed earlier than 1570 nor later
        than 1579. If this was the Anthony Colby who came to New England in 1630, he would then have been at least 50
        years of age! That by itself would not be too astounding, but his next feat, marriage to a young, recent widow
        who had the attractive attribute of owning property and not under the necessity of making an undesirable
        marriage arrangement, certainly would have been. (11) Next, this Anthony would have sired at least eight
        children, the last arriving when he was at least 70 years of age. For this to be the case, the wife Susannah
        would have had to be at least twenty years his junior. While not biologically impossible, these accomplishments
        are not very probable. Their improbability is further accentuated by a knowledge of what the immigrant Anthony
        did after coming to New England.

        In the old Norfolk County, Mass., records, (12) can be found an agreement made 4 Nov. 1658 between Willi:
        Osgood, Phillip Challis, William Barnes, Anthony Colby and Sam’ll Worcester, copartners, present possessors of a
        saw mill situated in Salisbury. David W. Hoyt in his work, ‘Old Families of Salisbury and Amesbury,’ (13)
        presents information concerning each of these men. According to Hoyt’s records, William Osgood was born about
        1609 and hence would have been about 49 years of age in 1658. Philip Challis, according to his own deposition,
        was born in 1617, and therefore 41 years of age in 1658. William Barnes would have been born between 1605 and
        1615, as his children are recorded as born from about 1640 to 1653; his age then in 1658 would have been between
        43 and 53, say 48 as a compromise. Samuel Worcester was first married in 1659 when he was about thirty, placing
        his birth about 1629. Compare these ages of 49, 41, 48 and 29, with the 78 years of the son of Thomas and
        Beatrice (Felton) Colby. The wording of the sawmill agreement is such as to make it seem that all were
        able-bodied men who would be personally laboring at the mill. For a man of 78 this would have been difficult,
        even if in excellent health. Association of a elderly man with men of middle years might be reasonable if he had
        superior financial capacity, but this does not seem to have been present to the advantage of Anthony Colby. The
        total value of his estate when appraised just three years later was only li 359, of which li 185 was in real
        estate and the remainder in various sundry personal goods. (14) of interest also is the fact that the inventory
        contained several items belonging to the saw mill and its activities. The logical conclusion that must be
        reached is that the Anthony Colby associated with the saw mill in 1658 was not in his late seventies, and
        therefore could not have been the son of Thomas and Beatrice (Felton) Colby of Beccles, England. The most
        enlightening information concerning this comes from the will of his brother Philip. (15) This will, made and
        proved in 1643, mentions, among others, two of his sisters, two of his brothers and seven nephews and nieces,
        including: Item I doe give into my brother Mr. Anthony Colby in present moneys xx li and doe give & confirm unto
        him his anuity or porsion being ffive pounds by ye yeare during the terme of his naturall life, payable at
        hollowmas and candlemas. Item I doe give unto his sonne Thomas Colby three score pounds to be payd unto him
        within one yeare next after my decease. This document is important because (1 it mentions Philip’s brother
        Anthony with no hint whatever that he was not residing in England, thirteen years after the American Anthony had
        arrived in New England, and (2 it shows that Anthony had a son Thomas in 1643 also presumably living in England.
        It would have been very unusual for Philip not to make provision for sending Anthony’s "ffive pounds by ye yeare
        during the term of his natural life" twice yearly, if this money was to have been transported to the New World!
        Failure to make such a provision is further indication that two Anthonys are involved. The second item quoted
        shows that Anthony had a son Thomas in 1643 who was to receive a substantial legacy within one year after his
        uncle Philip’s death. An examination of the American Anthony’s family, as presented earlier, indicates that his
        son Thomas was not born until 1650, with only sons John, Samuel and Isaac in 1643! Furthermore, none of the
        American Colbys would have been anywhere near their majority when the will was written. Had Philip’s nephew
        Thomas then been a minor, provision would certainly have been made for supervision of his legacy monies until a
        specified age was attained. In fact, this is exactly what Philip did with two of his three grandchildren with
        legacies to become due and payable when the grandchildren reached the ages of 16 and 14, respectively. The
        logical conclusion to be reached, again, is that Philip’s brother Anthony was not the same person as the
        Amesbury Anthony. While use of the given name Anthony in the Beccles Colby family does provide a valuable clue
        as to the immigrant’s possible ancestry, the Beccles branch of the Colby family had no monopoly of this
        Christian name. Edward Colbye, Gentleman, Of Banham, co. Norfolk, wrote his will 31 March 1580, proved 17 May
        1580, (16) in which he named, among others his wife Elizabeth, daughter Alice and sons Thomas, Francis, Anthony
        and Edward. The Banham parish registers contain the baptismal records of Edward (28 Jan 1560) and Thomas (14
        Sept. 1561), (17) but not those of Alice, Francis and Anthony. There seems to have been a break in the Banham
        registers from about 1565 to about 1580, and their births probably occurred during this time. This Anthony could
        logically be estimated as born about 1568, making him even older than the Beccles Anthony. The Colby family of
        Banham, co. Norfolk, and that of Beccles, co. Suffolk, were branches of the same family, sharing common
        ancestry. It can be seen that the name Anthony was known in both branches at least one generation before the
        American Anthony came to New England. Furthermore, two other contemporary Anthony Colbys can be located in
        England. In 1622, Elizabeth Colby, singlewoman of Matshell (Mattinshall?) , co. Norfolk, made a nuncupative will
        in which she left the majority of her goods to "Anthoney Collby my brother Also his wife"(18) but as Thomas and
        Beatrice did not have a daughter Elizabeth, this must be another Anthony, especially in light of the significant
        distance. The parish registers of St. Nicholas, Ipswich, Suffolk, (19) contain the baptismal record on 29 April
        1597 of Richard, son of Anthony Colby. The burials of this church show in 1604 - 29 Aug. John Colby } Richard
        Colby } fratres Ralph Davy 31 Aug Anthony Colby pater
    </p><p>

        The only similarity between the immigrant and the son of Thomas and Beatrice was the given name. However, other
        Anthony’s located in England, without any additional documentation, have just as valid a claim to be the New
        England immigrant. Further research into source material in Suffolk and Norfolk may reveal the parentage of the
        immigrant to New England who now has a large posterity in America, including the author of this article.
        Nevertheless, until documentation is forthcoming, the parentage of Anthony Colby of Amesbury must be regarded as
        unknown, and the previously accepted connection with the son of Thomas and Beatrice (Felton) Colby must be
        discarded.
